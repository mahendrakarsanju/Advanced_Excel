# 📊 Dashboard on Credit Card Transactions

## 🧾 Overview

This project presents an interactive and analytical dashboard built from a dataset of credit card transactions. The objective of this dashboard is to derive actionable insights from transactional data using data visualization and business intelligence techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze customer transaction patterns
- Visualize transaction volume, frequency, and trends
- Identify top-performing customer segments
- Explore spending behavior based on category, region, and time
- Support decision-making for customer retention and risk analysis

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - Charts & Graphs
  - Dashboard Layouts
- **Power BI** *(optional for future scalability)*
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Excel formulas & filters

## 📌 Key Features

- 📅 Time-based transaction trend analysis  
- 🧍‍♂️ Customer segmentation based on transaction behavior  
- 💳 Categorization of credit card expenses  
- 📈 Performance metrics with dynamic filtering

## 📂 Files

- `Dashboard on Credit_card_transactions_[1].xlsx` – The Excel file containing the processed data, pivot tables, and the interactive dashboard.

## 📈 Insights

Some of the insights generated from the dashboard include:
- Peak transaction months and high-spending categories
- Customer clusters based on usage intensity
- Most and least active regions
- Year-on-year or month-on-month growth (if time data is available)

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Migrate dashboard to Power BI for more interactive filtering
- Include anomaly detection to identify fraudulent transactions
- Connect to a live SQL database for real-time updates
- Embed ML models for predictive insights (e.g., churn prediction)
